      <h2>AI and its Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence has had huge impacts in the healthcare sector, especially since the pandemic last year.
        AI and other disruptive technologies powered a patient-centered healthcare system. This new care scenario is all
        digital and highlights the importance of data and analytics. Predictive analytics, machine learning, and AI
        played a pivotal role in drug discovery and vaccine development. In the coming years, the use of these advanced
        technologies will become the norm, and easily accessible electronic medical records will simplify diagnostics.
        AI will enable healthcare systems to track and monitor patients in real-time, gain genetic data, and each
        person’s lifestyle. Algorithms will take up the charge of diagnosing health conditions and prescribing suitable
        treatments.</h3>
      <p>Artificial intelligence has had a huge impact on many industries in recent years and will continue to benefit
        them in the future. The pandemic-induced acceleration of technology adoption has led many sectors, both private
        and public to leverage AI for their advantage and growth. In the last few years, AI has enabled many innovations
        and driven the proliferation of technologies like IoT, robotics, analytics, and voice assistants. According to a
        report, AI topped the patent filings in 2020. This is not new, AI has been securing a large number of patents in
        the last few years.</p>
     
      <p>It’s from past 20 years that the technology of AI has been continually evolving and astonishing us with various
        new innovations. Today, AI is categorised as a mature technology that is capable of changing the face of the
        world. Due to its faster growth and high-tech innovations, many organisations are actively opting for AI in one
        or the different way.

        “By 2030, most social situations will be facilitated by bots — intelligent-seeming programs that interact with
        us in human-like ways. At home, parents will engage skilled bots to help kids with homework and catalyze dinner
        conversations. At work, bots will run meetings. A bot confidant will be considered essential for psychological
        well-being, and we’ll increasingly turn to such companions for advice ranging from what to wear to whom to
        marry.”—Judith Donath, Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society

        This might sound superficial, but the way AI has grown in the past time and has impacted our lives, we should be
        ready for more surprises that Artificial intelligence future might bring to us.

        Today, there are many organisations that are indulge on various AI projects and are giving a new meaning to the
        future of technology. We have seen some really interesting examples like AI-driven driverless cars, facial
        recognition feature, AI auto pilot mode in commercial flights, deep-learning neural networks in the workplace
        etc. that makes us believe that Artificial Intelligence future is definitely beyond our imagination and will
        keep surprising us with such amazing innovations.
